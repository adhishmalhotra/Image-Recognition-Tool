The name of the main folder is FinalProjSOFE73375. 

the python code is stored in directory named DataStructuresFinalProject

the MNIST_DS directory contains all the images which have been renamed for the sake of simplicity

how to run the code in Visual Studio Code? 

1. open vscode
2. open the folder FinalProjSOFE73375 with the help of OPEN FOLDER option. 
3. Then access the code present in the directtory DataStructuresFinalProject 
4. run and debug the python code 
5. NOTE: make sure the whole folder FinalProjSOFE73375 is opened in VSCODE editor for the same results as the report

The report for the final project of data structures is also present in the main folder. 

Thank you!
